Converting .ov file to a .mat file for analysis in Matlab, v0.1

Instructions for Windows, Linux hackers should be able to modify the necessary parts.

Requirements: OpenViBE v1.1.0 installed in the usual location and matlab.

NOTES
-----
The script assumes that each .ov file contains a signal stream and a stimulation stream. Other streams are discarded.

The signal conversion is not bit perfect as it goes through a CSV file, with a decimal precision of 10.


INSTALL
--------
First, we need to patch openvibe v1.1.0:

- Replace ov2csv.xml in "C:\Program Files (x86)\openvibe\share\openvibe\scenarios\convert" with the file from this package


USAGE
----- 
To convert a file, do the following in Matlab

>> convert_ov2mat('inputFile.ov', 'outputFile.mat')

The resulting variable names in the .mat should be clear enough as to their content. The 'stims' contains stimulation time, ID, and duration, respectively.

To convert a folder of files, you can try the 'convert_ovfolder.m' script, but remember to edit the variables first
